To get lyrics of a song u want

I have tried import 'lyricsgenius', but later it was showing traceback error
Then I had to switch to another library, it was easier, and that the website provided the link for a GUI for showijg lyrics
There were some some bugs while displaying the lyrics, I have corrected almost all of them.
But the only thing I couldn't resolve was to add a scrollbar to the UI, when the lyrics too long to fit into the window
I tried storing the lyrics in ListBox for adding the scrollbar, but it ended up showing errors, so I had to drop that idea
The cons are as follow:- No scrollbar, Limited songs available in the library, changing the positions of the label as well as entry box.
